In the last month and a half I&#8217;ve built out a launch page site at [KellyOrr.com][1], a professional blog at [ContinuousRefactor.com][2], a personal blog at [43five.com][3] and a photo stream at [Fotographiti.com][4].  Aside from the hosting space, I have used a suite of free tools.  Here is the list:

  * [Retaggr][5] &#8211; the Definitive Online Profile.  This service dynamically builds and serves out the badge that appears on KellyOrr.com and ContinuousRefactor.com with a collection of logos for each social network on online service that I use.  It shows a brief description of who I am, my picture and my last Twitter update.
  * [Facebook][6] &#8211; helps you connect and share with the people in your life.  This site is primarly used for personal social networking.  It enables you to link with colleagues and friends and share udpates, photos and Facebook-enabled games.
  * [LinkedIn][7] &#8211; Over 30 million professionals use LinkedIn to exchange information, ideas and opportunities.  The network enables users to stay updates about colleagues as they move between jobs.  I used it to keep an ever-current online resume of my professional activities.
  * [Twitter][8]. I often call this micro-blogging.  Twitter enables you to update your status from anywhere you have access to a web browser.
  * [Ping.fm][9] &#8211; a simple service that makes updating your social networks a snap.  I type my updates into the website at Ping.fm and each social network that I have identified in my account is updated automatically.
  * [Flickr][10] &#8211; a Yahoo! service for storing pictures online.  Admittedly, I do pay for the Pro version of this service, the free version is very powerful and only puts limits on daily uploads.
  * [Flickriver][11] &#8211; this service creates a photo stream of pictures from a flickr account.  I like how it presents the pictures and allows users to search by keywords and sort by tags.
  * [BlogEngine.NET][12] &#8212; BE.N, as it&#8217;s often referred to by fellow developers, is my blog software of choice.  It’s simple, effective, skin-able, written in .NET and free.  I run my personal and professional blogs from it.
  * [WordPress ][13]&#8211; [Update Jan 28 2011] Since Microsoft has deployed Live blogs on WordPress and since it has taken off like wildfire in the last two years, I have switched my blog to WordPress as well.  I run the locally installed version available from WordPress.org.
  * [Skype][14] &#8212; I used to pay more than $50 per month for a land line and dial tone with no voicemail or caller ID out here on the countryside.  Now that land-based high speed Internet is available, I got rid of my home-office land line and use Skype instead.  For a dedicated number, I pay about $5 a quarter!  Skype-to-Skype calls are free and people can call my Skype number from anywhere in the world and I can take the call anywhere in the world that I can get access to the Internet and Skype.  I&#8217;ve used the service and my account in Germany and Russia with no problems.
  * [Gmail][15] &#8212; For years I insisted on using my own domain names and Microsoft Outlook for email.  I still use my own domain names, but I got rid of Outlook when I realized I have access to Google’s search horsepower in a GMail account.  I no longer have hundreds of nested folders that I sort mail into.  All of my mail gets tagged and added to a single archive folder.  Now I search instead of sort.
  * [Amazon.com][16] &#8212; I signed up for an Amazon.com Associate account.  When I write book reviews or list books referenced in talks that I&#8217;ve attended, the pictures of the books come from Amazon.  If a reader clicks the book, they are transferred over to Amazon and if they buy the book, I receive a commission from Amazon.
  * [Google Analytics][17] &#8212; I&#8217;ve used several web traffic analytics tools over the years, but they all pale in comparison to Google Analytics.  The basic version is extremely powerful and, of course, free.  Once you sign up for your account, Google will generate a simple snippet of code for you to add to your website.  That code will send information about each visitor to Google for analysis.  The aggregated data is presented in numerous reports for your review via a web interface.
  * [Clustrmaps][18] &#8212; This service provides a push pin style map of where your readers are located.  The more visitors you have from a location, the bigger the head of the push pin.  This map is available as a dynamic graphic to include on your site.  The service is free.
