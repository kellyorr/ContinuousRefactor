&#8220;Do you use the same dough every time you make bread?&#8221;

&#8220;I use the same recipe&#8221;

That was the brief discussion at dinner tonight.  I couldn&#8217;t resist teaching my young family about the [object oriented programming][1] concept of object instantiation.  The analogy goes like this:

The recipe is the [object][2].  The dough is the [instance][3].  Arguably the oven would be the[ factory method][4] and the bread would be the instance.

So, no, you wouldn&#8217;t use the same dough each time to make bread.  Dough would be an instance of the BreadRecipe object.
