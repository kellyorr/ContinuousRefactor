The next several posts are a multiple part series based on a project management methodology and project management office I helped construct a few years ago.  These posts come from academic lessons learned during a Advanced Strategic Project Management class I took at Villanova University.  The questions I propose help the practical application.

1/ [Project Considerations][1]  
2/ Project Selection  
3/ Project Portfolio Selection Example  
4/ Planning Project Work Packages  
5/ Project Monitoring and Evaluation  
6/ Organizational Capability Maturity Model
