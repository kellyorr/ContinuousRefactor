I just finished an excellent book by software project management guru and author [Steve McConnell][1] called [Software Project Survival Guide][2]. After over twelve years in the IT industry as a developer, business analyst, team leader, project manager, architect, engineer and consultant, I was expecting this book to a be a good review and in many ways it was. But as the title implies, it is an excellent *guide*. It took me through areas of the trade that I am very familiar with and it introduced me to a few more tools and techniques that I&#8217;m anxious to put to use. As the author describes, he uses three main references in writing the book: [The Capability Maturity Model Integration][3] (CMMI) from the[Software Engineering Institute][4] (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA, NASA Software Engineering Laboratory&#8217;s (SEL&#8217;s) Recommended Approach to Software Development, Revision 3, and third, his own experience which itself is extensive.Â  I highly recommend this book to any one leading or supporting software development projects.
