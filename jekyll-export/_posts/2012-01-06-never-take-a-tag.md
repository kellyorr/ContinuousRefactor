Do you want to take the tag?  Last fall, I was offered a &#8216;tag&#8217; during a paintball match.  Being new to the sport, I didn&#8217;t understand what the referee was wanting me to answer.  He then shouted, &#8220;Do you want to walk away?&#8221;.  Instantly and nearly in unison, I shouted &#8216;NO!&#8217; and the referee belted &#8220;game on!&#8221;  My adrenaline saturated opponent stood up and point blank range unloaded on me.  The resulting impact to my ribs reminded me of the Far Side comic: Bummer of a Birthmark Hal![<img class=" wp-image-153 alignright" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Shot" src="http://www.continuousrefactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Shot.png" alt="" width="210" height="184" />][1]

I could have &#8216;taken the tag&#8217; and skipped the bruising.  But for the rest of that day, I would have repeatedly been a victim of &#8216;death by proxy&#8217; as other players would decide to stand next to me and yell &#8220;tag!&#8221;.  Take a hit and wear a bruise.  Take a tag and forever by an easy target.  This was a temporary bruise barely more than surface deep and a bigger bruise to my ego than to my skin.  But in retrospect, I learned a valuable life lesson.

Have you ever been in a situation where you were offered the easy way out?  What would have been the immediate price?  What would have been the long term cost?

Never take a tag.
