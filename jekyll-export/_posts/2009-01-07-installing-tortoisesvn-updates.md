For whatever reason, the Tortoise update notices like the one shown here are always intimidating to me.  I right click and select &#8216;SVN Update&#8217; and get the update checker pop-up.  I think, &#8220;What? There is another update?  I&#8217;m not running the newest version?  What am I missing?  Was there something in the last versions that could be a risk to me?  How long will this take to update?  Where do I go again and what do I do?&#8221;

It&#8217;s quite simple really.  Here are the steps:

  1. Notice the pop-up and think &#8220;Gee, I should update this.  It&#8217;ll only take a minute.&#8221;
  2. Browse out to http://tortoisesvn.com and click the &#8216;Download&#8217; link at the top of the page.
  3. Scroll down and select the version needed for your computer.
  4. Save the file.  I prefer to just put it on my desktop so I can easily find it again.
  5. Double click and walk through the installation.
  6. Reboot.  Done.
