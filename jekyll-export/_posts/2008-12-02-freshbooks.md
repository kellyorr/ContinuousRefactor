Although I wouldn&#8217;t say it is perfectly paperless now, I would say that I&#8217;m very close, say 98%. The bulk of the heavy lifting is done with Freshbooks. It is a fantastic SaaS online tool that lets me keep my finger on the accounting from any where that has an Internet connection. May favorite features include automated billing with tried and true &#8220;set it and forget it&#8221; functionality. They also interface with my payment gateway, PayPal, and Amazon Payments as well as allowing me to receive paper checks (remember that 2% remaining) and process them manually. Recurring invoices can be automatically emailed or postal mailed monthly. Estimates can be created, emailed to the client, accepted by the client online for tracking and converted to an invoice. Reporting is extensive enough to for accounts receiveable enterprise-wide or per client. I highly recommend Freshbooks for paperless, automated, efficiently accounts receivable accounting.
