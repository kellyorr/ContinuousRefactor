Several of my colleagues referred me to Scott Gu&#8217;s blog entry on ASP.NET Chart Component for the .NET Framework 3.5.  I had time to take a first look tonight.  I downloaded the component, the Visual Studio 2008 tool support and the sample project.  Each package installed easily.  I copied the sample project into the IIS directory on Vista and after encountering several error messages, I set the directory to be an application.  The first look is very impressive.  I&#8217;ve purchased packages from Infragistics and DotNetCharting over the last four years and this free component easily meets or beats quality and quantity of charting options offered by those packages.
