The first presenter was **Brian H. Prince**, Architect Evangelist for Microsoft [Blog][2]

  * Mentors &#8212; pick something you want to grow in and assemble mentors 
      * Write down a mentor list and keep track of strategy
      * Mentors don&#8217;t have to know they are your mentor
      * Discard mentorships as needed
  * &#8220;You are in charge of your career, your company is in charge of your job&#8221; &#8212; [@dmarsh][3]
  * Be introspective 
      * Review your job annually and mentally sign-up for another year
      * Check to see if you job is still aligned with your career objectives
      * Clearly define your career objectives
      * Pick something you want to be known as
  * Invest in your career: school, playing, reading, blogging, code camps
  * Book Recommendation: *Who Says Elephants Can&#8217;t Dance?*by Lou Gerstner

  * Book Recommendation: *Rules for Revolutionaries*by Guy Kawasaki
  * Just like body building, work out different muscles (skills) each day.
  * Creativity 
      * You need to practice it to strengthen it.
      * Design a system, throw out the design, do it again differently two more times to boost creativity
      * Mix it up; read a book you normally wouldn&#8217;t
      * Read a book a week
  * Book Recommendation: *The Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What it Means to All of Us*by Robyn Meredith

  * Tips for client interaction 
      * Say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;
      * Be an active listener
      * Don&#8217;t have distractions
      * Ask smart questions
      * Don&#8217;t multitask in your head
      * Ask open-minded questions, not yes/no questions
      * Take notes even if to just map the conversation
      * Use metaphors or analogies to communicate
      * Don&#8217;t use bad language
      * Follow through (review action items and send a follow-up email)
      * Over communicate until they bleed
      * No agenda, no attenda
      * Be prepared
      * Preception is reality
  * Objections: Feel.  Felt.  Found. 
      * &#8220;I understand how you feel.  Others have felt the same way.  Others have found&#8230;&#8221;
      * Make finding a solution to the problem something we are going to work on together.
  * Don&#8217;t be a plumber.  Write code that only you can write to add value to the business.
  * Do more of what works and less of what doesn&#8217;t
  * Focus on helping the end-user kick a$$.
  * Architecture/Career/Life is about balance.
  * The effort is the effort and is not negotiable.  Don&#8217;t merely reduce a quote, but de-scope or get more money.
  * Project manager&#8217;s job is about communication.
  * Project fail because of failed expectations or communications not because of technology.
  * Teams should play together.
  * Always hold the door.
  * Never burn a bridge behind you.  &#8220;You can&#8217;t burn your way to excellence.&#8221;

The second speaker was **Michael Wood**, SDS.  [Blog][4].  He spoke on[Organizational Dynamics][5].

  * Four areas: Responsbility, Authority, Power, Influence.
  * Economics in one line:  Profit = Revenue &#8211; Cost
  * &#8220;I need to add value to the business&#8221;
  * Director: &#8220;I need to get the right people on the right projects&#8221;
  * Manager: &#8220;I need to make sure everyone is happy.&#8221;  Authority but no power.
  * Architects: Influence and responsbility, but little Power and Authority.
  * Co-worker: &#8220;I want to work on cool technology with people that carry their weight.&#8221;
  * Yor agenda: &#8220;I need to choose technologies with a future.&#8221;
  * Focus on adding business value and project success not necessarily efficiency.
  * Agile: plotted backlog of items that can add business value fast.
  * Survival Tips: 
      * Dress + 1, one level better than the audience.  First impressions matter.
      * Plug into companies information pipeline
      * Learn the art of small talk
      * Be prepared to have the hard conversations.
      * Learn to read the room.

      * Decisions should not be *made *but *announced*at meetings.
      * Keep an eye on the sharks
      * Learn the right way to gripe. Not 30 minutes of griping, but 5 minutes of griping and 25 minutes of suggesting solutions.
  * Political tools 
      1. Compromise (win-win)
      2. Arbitration (independent third part)
      3. Escalation
      * Arguing hurts the business value
      * Accept decisions and move on
      * There is *always *a different point of view
      * Always maintain your composure.  It ruins you credibility if you don&#8217;t.
      * Know your boundaries and limitations (constraints)
