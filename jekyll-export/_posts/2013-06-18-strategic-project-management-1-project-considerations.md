  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This is the first installment in a <a title="Series of Strategic Project Management Posts" href="http://www.continuousrefactor.com/2012/10/25/series-strategic-project-management/">series of strategic project management posts</a>.  I am taking the content directly out of </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Project Management: Strategic Design and Implementation</span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> by Cleland and Ireland.  It is available on <a title="Project Management: Strategic Design and Implementation" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/007147160X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=007147160X&linkCode=as2&tag=continuousrefactor-20">Amazon</a>.<br /> </span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /> </span>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Some considerations for constructing an organization&#8217;s model for a portfolio of projects are:</span>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Projects are typically approved for the purpose of developing and delivering new products and services or effecting organizational change.  These projects should be used in a balanced manner to advance the organizational change.  In these turbulent times, an organization needs to focus on rapid delivery of products and services as well as changing the organization&#8217;s processes to obtain more productivity for future work.</span></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Projects need to have balance between providing products and services today and as future building blocks to position for tomorrow&#8217;s work.  For example, an organization might have an R&D program using projects to redesign or develop new products in anticipation of retiring some existing product lines</span></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Projects are the means for action and implementing strategic plans.  Well-designed and well-implemented projects can contribute to an organizations success today and in the future.</span></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Core competencies drive which projects should be selected and successfully implemented.  Making a decision to conduct a project outside of one&#8217;s core competencies adds risk and introduces a level of risk that may be unacceptable or the organization.</span>

    <strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Discussion</span></strong>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On the first and second points, one thing that I see happen is companies developing and deploying multiple custom solutions due to customers demand.  With limited financial resources, a company&#8217;s resource utilization can reach a critical melting point.  Even with faster deployments, there will be limits on human capacity to support this strategy.  Reducing the number of custom applications by integrating them into a single platform is often a viable approach.  To the client, it may seem as though they have a custom service solution, but to the provider, it is far more efficient and profitable if the underlying code base and management infrastructure was really just one solution.  </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It is not as flexible as a pure custom point solution, but it can provide literally hundreds of different solutions on a single platform.  One-off proof of concept projects may be needed to prove the feasibility, but over time a single platform should be build and sold as a service.  </span>

</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">On the third point, the notion of &#8220;projects&#8221; is often be used to name deliverables to clients.  But with most businesses, internal work seems to have happened by </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">unmanaged</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> magic, &#8220;as you have time, but it&#8217;s of equal importance&#8221;.  Huge efficiency gains can be realized by applying project management techniques to internal projects, giving them a value, tracking earned value and decided whether to do them or not based on value instead of whim.</span>

  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /> </span>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The fourth point really hits home.  Service providers and consultancies can&#8217;t be everything to everyone.  If tried, they will be nothing to everyone.  Clearly define what you company does and then closely guard that definition.  Put it in the marketing collateral and on the website</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">.  There are two sides of the coin here.  If you don&#8217;t already have descriptive definitions of the service offering on the website, then you likely don&#8217;t do it.  The flip side is that if you really do offer the service, you&#8217;ve offered it before, and it has been delivered successfully and proven profitable, but you don&#8217;t have marketing collateral or website content, then create it and actively market and sell the service.</span>

  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Questions</b></span>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What point solutions do you have that can be rolled together into a common single solution as a service?</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What services do you think you offer, but no one knows that you do?</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What services do your clients pay you for and you deliver but not profitably?</span>
