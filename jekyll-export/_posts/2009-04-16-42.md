[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-43" title="YouAreWhatYouRead" src="http://www.continuousrefactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/YouAreWhatYouRead.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="207" hspace="5" />][1]Philippe Kruchtenn at the University of British Columbia published an article entitled [*You Are What You Read*][2] in the Career Development section of IEEE*Software*, March/April 2009.  In the article he indicates that his favorite interview question is to ask the candicate what they have read lately.  He goes on to discuss *what *to read: books, journals, blogs; *when *to read; and *how to retain* what you&#8217;ve read.  He develops the concept of a fieldstone to use a sort of bookmark with notes.  Near the conclusion of the article is a real gem, a link to a list of the [Top 100 Best Software Engineering Books][3] as listed by [Jurgen Appello][4], the CIO at ISM eCompany in The Netherlands.  I noticed that the author of the book I recently reviewed, Steve McConnell, has four books in the top 100 list with *Software Project Survival Guide* as #47.
